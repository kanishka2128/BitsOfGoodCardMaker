        Hi! My name is Kanishka Kislaya and I'm a first-year CS student here at Georgia Tech.
        I love to read and write books (I've written 5 â€” you can check them out in the links below),
        as well as teach people how to express their creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know Bits of Good is the right place for me as I love making an impact on people's lives and I believe
        this club will help me on my journey towards that goal. Can't wait to meet all you amazing people!
      </p>
